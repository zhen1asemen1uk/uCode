        <p>Peter Parker was orphaned at the age of 6 when his parents were killed in an airplane crash overseas. He went
            to live with his uncle and aunt, Ben and May Parker, in Forest Hills, New York. Parker was extremely bright
            and became a high honors student at Midtown High School. Parker's shyness and scholastic interest often made
            him a social outcast. One evening Parker attended a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of
            nuclear laboratory waste materials sponcored by the General Techtronics Corporation. During the
            demonstration, a small Common House Spider happened to be in the path of a particle accelerator's beam and
            was massively irradiated. The stricken spider fell on to Parker's hand, broke his skin with its fangs, and
            died. His hand burning from the bite, Parker left the exhibition. Parker made his way home and passed
            through an unfamiliar section of the city where he was accosted by a gang of hoodlums. Tossing the gang
            members aside, Parker was shocked by his own display of strength. As he fled from them, he ran into the path
            of a speeding car, and leaped to safety about 30 feet up onto a nearby wall. To his growing surprise, he
            discovered that he was able to stick to the wall with his fingertips. As he easily walked down a guy wire to
            the street below, he realized that henow possessed a superb sense of balance. Parker quickly associated
            these spider-like abilities with the bitefrom the irradiated spider.</p>
        <p>Parker went home, where his Aunt May sent him on an errand to deliver clothing to a charity driver located in
            a nearby National Guard Armory. There he saw a wrestling match witch offered a prize for anyone who could
            remain in the ring at least 3 minutes with a professional wrestler. Interested in testing his new-found
            powers, Parker decided to accept the wrestler's challenge. Wearing a mask to conceal his features to avoid
            embarassment in cast he lost, he easily defeated his opponent. A television producer's talent agent spotted
            him and promised him a segment on a network variety show. Parker, calling himself the Amazing Spider-Man,
            accepted the offer and decided to use it as a springboard to a show business career as a spectacular stunt
            performer. Over the next several evenings, Parker used equipment borrowed from his high school to fabricate
            a fluid that imitated a spider's silk web, and spinneret devices to project that fluid from his wrists in
            the form of a web strand. He also silkscreened his original design for a costume onto a body stocking and
            full-head mask. Thus prepared, Peter Parker appeared as Spider-Man on national television and was an
            immediate media sensation.</p>
        <p>Just after the conclusion of the television show, a buglar, being pursued by a security guard, ran by Parker
            who impetuously allowed him to pass although he could have easily stopped him. When reprimanded by the
            guard, Parker arrogantly replied he was a professional performer and that chasing criminals was the guard's
            job. Parker promptly forgot the incident. A few days later, Parker returned home to find that his Uncle Ben
            had been murdered by a burglar. A police officer informed him that the burglar had been trailed to a nearby
            abandoned warehouse where the police had him trapped. Grief-stricken, Parker rushed to the warehouse to seek
            vengeance. At the warehouse Parker, as Spider-Man, easily captured the burglar and realized that he was the
            same person that he had allowed to run past him earlier that day in the TV studio. He realized that if he
            had acted responsibly earlier, he might have prevented the death of his uncle. Filled with remorse, he
            realized that with power comes responsibility, and he vowed to never shirk that responsibility again.</p>
        <p>Peter began to use his powers to fight crime. He also tried to join the hero team Fantastic Four in their
            formative stages but was dismissed. As a solo hero, Parker took pictures of his fights as Spider-Man using
            an automatic camera, and then sold the pictures to the Daily Bugle. Spider-Man rapidly became one of the
            most well-known citizens in New York City, although, unfortunately, many people think of him as a menace due
            to the editorials of Bugle's editor J. Jonah Jameson. Parker's main concern about Aunt May was that, if she
            ever found out his secret identity as Spider-Man, it would aggravate her weak heart condition. <br>During
            this time, Parker dated Betty Brant of the Daily Bugle, although Liz Allen had a crush on him. At the same
            time, both Aunt May and her neighbor, Aunt Anna, were encouraging Parker to date Anna's niece, Mary Jane
            Watson, whom he would not meet until months later.</p>
        <p> After high school, Parker enrolled in Empire State University, and divided his time as a hero, a student,
            and photographer. Eventually, Parker moved into his own apartment. During this time, he developed a
            relationship with Gwen Stacey. Unfortunately, during Spider-Man's conflict with the original Green Goblin,
            Stacey was killed. Some time later, Parker developed a steady relationship with Mary Jane. Parker proposed
            marriage, although Mary Jane declined, and soon left Parker's life for many months.</p>
